Symfony2 Yohang Distribution
============================

This Symfony distribution is a custom version of the Symfony standard edition that fits
to my personal needs.

It includes, in other things:

 * NPM for server side javascripts dependencies (coffescript, less and bower)
 * Bower for client side dependencies
 * Some client-side libraries (html5shiv, jquery, underscore, bootstrap)
 * A Twitter bootstrap form layout
 * A default assetic configuration

And add some changes:

 * Splitted configuration files
 * Moved session dir to avoid loosing sessions on cache:clear
